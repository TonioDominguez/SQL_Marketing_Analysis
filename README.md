  <h2>About the Project :bar_chart:	</h2>

  <p>
    The objective of this mini project is to explore and analyze a marketing database using MySQL queries, followed by visualizations created with Python. For this we are going to take as a start the same dataset that I already used in <strong><a href="https://github.com/TonioDominguez/Midproject_Marketing_Data_Analysis">midproject for Ironhack</a></strong>, a database with a marketing theme.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Objective:</h3>
  <p>
    Our aim is to extract insights from the marketing database through SQL queries and visualize the results using Python. By analyzing various metrics and trends within the data, we seek to gain a deeper understanding of the marketing strategies employed and their effectiveness.
  </p>
  
<h3>Methodology:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><u><strong>Data Extraction:</strong></u> We begin by extracting relevant data from the marketing database using SQL queries. This involves retrieving information on customer interactions, campaign performance, and other key metrics.</li>
    <li><u><strong>Data Visualization:</strong></u> Once the data is extracted, we employ Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create insightful visualizations. These plots help us visualize trends, patterns, and correlations present in the data.</li>
  </ol>

<h2>Project Structure :open_file_folder:</h2>

<p>
  This project is developed through two steps.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong><a href="https://github.com/TonioDominguez/SQL_Marketing_Analysis/blob/main/SQL/queries_general.sql">SQL Queries:</a></strong> We utilize MySQL to perform queries on the marketing database. These queries extract data based on specific criteria, allowing us to gather meaningful insights.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <strong><a href="https://github.com/TonioDominguez/SQL_Marketing_Analysis/blob/main/python%20EDA/Marketing%20EDA.ipynb">Data Visualization with Python:</a></strong> This Nb is intended for the interpretation of data from the previously cleaned dataset. We break down the statistics of the customers, their consumption patterns and ways of purchasing and their activities in campaigns.
  </li>
  
</ol>

<p>
  As a final presentation of what has been developed and obtained in this project, we also include some explanatory slides. You can download the slides from <strong><a href="https://github.com/TonioDominguez/SQL_Marketing_Analysis/blob/main/slides/Mini-Quest%20Consultas%20SQL%20%2B%20An%C3%A1lisis.pdf">here</a></strong>.

  <h2>Conclusion :eye:</h2>

  <p>
   Through this mini project, we aimed to demonstrate our proficiency in utilizing SQL for data extraction and Python for data visualization. By combining these skills, we were able to derive valuable insights from the marketing database, enabling informed decision-making and strategic planning for future marketing endeavors.
  </p>

  <p>
    We hope you find this mini project insightful and informative, showcasing our capabilities in database querying and data visualization techniques.
